name : "reasoning"
description : "Control omi reasoning effort level to balance depth, rigor, latency, and token cost."
---

## Purpose

Use this skill to set an explicit reasoning posture before planning, execution, or verification-heavy turns.

## Trigger

- User asks for faster vs deeper reasoning
- Session needs tighter quality gates or lower latency
- Team wants predictable planning/verification effort across stages

## Supported Effort Levels

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`
- `xhigh`

## Workflow

1. Identify requested effort or infer `medium` as default.
2. Explain impact on planning depth, verification strictness, and cost/latency.
3. Persist/update `.omi/state/reasoning.json` when filesystem tools are available.
4. Recommend a next command (`/omi:mode`, `/omi:team`, or `/omi:loop`) based on posture.
