description : "Deliver many independent tasks quickly with shard-based execution and periodic quality gates."
---

## Purpose

Use this skill for throughput-heavy work: many small or moderately independent tasks.

## Trigger

- Backlog contains many parallelizable items
- Speed matters but basic quality gates must remain
- User asks for batch execution mode

## Workflow

1. Split backlog into shards by dependency and risk.
2. Execute shards in short cycles using implementation-focused agents.
3. Run periodic review gates after each shard batch.
4. Track unresolved shard-level risks.
5. Produce a batched completion and carry-over summary.
